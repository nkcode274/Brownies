Firstly, grease a 9x13 dark metal pan, and then line it with parchment paper. 

Then, combine the chopped chocolate, 1/4 cup of cocoa powder, and espresso powder in a bowl. 

Thirdly, add the butter to a small saucepan over medium heat and cook until the butter simmers. Immediately pour the butter into the chocolate mixture and let it sit for 2 minutes. Then whisk until completely incorporated. 

Next, combine the granulated sugar, the brown sugar, vanilla extract, salt, and eggs in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Then add the chcolate and butter mixture and blend until smooth. 

Proceed to preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Then sift the flour and the remaining cocoa powder and use a spatula to gently folt it until combined. 

Pour the batter into the greased baking pan and bake for about 20 minutes. 

After it is finished, remove the bbaking pan and lightly drop it on a flat surface 1-2 times until the brownies deflate slightly. This way they will be smooth. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt. 

Return the pan to the oven and bake until a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the brownies comes out fudgy, but the edges are cooked through. 

Allow the brownies to cool completely. 

Enjoy!
